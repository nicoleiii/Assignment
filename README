# Assignment
 
For the main page:

I chose to do the slideshow because I believed that it will showcase my work the best. This is because when someone opens my website the first thing they see is my work. 

I chose to do an About Me as having an About Me section on the first page in my opinion is a good idea. It allows for the reader to instantly know about me as well as any recent projects I have done. I chose to have the first image on the left and the second on the right as it gives a unique layout. It took me a while to figure out how to do it but eventually I figured it out. 

I decided to do a simple footer because I do not have any external links for my hobby that people can access. My navigation bar is also simple because most people prefer simple designs rather than complicated and busy.

I did black and red as people prefer darker colors to be had on websites so they don't get flashbanged by white.

For Services:

I decided to do a simple table. Allows for the reader to know my prices amd what I offer without having to read a lot. 

I chose to do red as having grey will just fade into the background.

For Porfolio:

I decided to do a mix of portrait and landscape as it allows for the reader to know how my work looks like from multiple angles. I added a video to show the customer how my work looks like when it's moving and that it is not broken. 

I made it simple and not too complex as it is easier for the reade to see. 

Contact:

A simple contact page. I did red instead of grey/black because it will just fade into the background. 

Website Overall:

For the website overall I decided to make it very simple with not that much pages as I do not want my website to be too complicated and have a lot going on. I only got to the point and showed what should be shown.
